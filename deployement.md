# Project mAdbWpu-R Deployment
This note documents how our **data product** moves from *staging* to production.  
It follows the security and scaling rules defined under guardrail token `2gr-uugjyishz-f0`.
```mermaid
graph TD
    edge-xp["Edge Cache (edge-xp)"] --> api-cflk4x["API Tier (api-cflk4x)"]
    api-cflk4x --> worker-e7puzb["Background Worker (worker-e7puzb)"]

    
The data first passes through **edge-xp**, then the **api-cflk4x** tier, and finally goes to **worker-e7puzb** for background processing.  
Run `uv deploy madbwpu-r` to ship the release.
### Deployment Tasks

- [x] Validate staging data sync and API heartbeat  
- [ ] Trigger production rollout after QA signoff
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Guardrail token `2gr-uugjyishz-f0` must be validated before production cutover.  
> Any ~~manual bypass~~ is not allowed.
| Tier | Responsibility | Scaling Plan |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| Edge Cache | CDN & latency reduction | Auto-scale globally |
| API Tier | Request handling | Horizontal scaling via K8s |
| Background Workers | Async processing | Dynamic scaling per queue depth |
The deployment follows strict audit standards [^compliance-060i].
[^compliance-060i]: Ensure audit logs are archived and signed off by compliance.
